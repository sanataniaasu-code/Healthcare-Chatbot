# Healthcare Chatbot (Mini Project)


A simple ML-powered healthcare chatbot that: intent classification using TF-IDF + Logistic Regression, a rule-based symptom-to-disease mapper, and a Flask web UI.


## Features
- Intent detection (greeting, symptom_check, health_faq, department, goodbye)
- Symptom → possible disease mapper (rule-based, for demo only)
- Flask frontend (chat UI)


## How to run
1. Create a virtual environment (recommended) and activate it.
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
